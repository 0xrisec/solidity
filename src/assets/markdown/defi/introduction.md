## What is DeFi?

`DeFi` stands for Decentralized Finance which refers to a new type of financial system that uses blockchain technology to provide financial services without relying on traditional financial institutions such as banks.

`DeFi` applications are built on blockchain networks such as Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other similar platforms, and they use smart contracts to automate financial transactions. `DeFi` applications can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection and a compatible cryptocurrency wallet, without requiring a middleman.

Some examples of `DeFi` applications include:

**1. Decentralized exchanges (DEXs):** These are platforms where users can trade cryptocurrencies with each other in a decentralized and trustless manner. This means that users can trade cryptocurrencies without needing a middleman such as a centralized exchange or broker.

`DeFi` is an exciting and rapidly growing sector of the blockchain industry, as it has the potential to disrupt traditional finance by providing a more open, transparent, and accessible financial system. However, it's important to note that DeFi is still a relatively new and experimental field, and it comes with its own set of risks and challenges, such as smart contract vulnerabilities, market volatility, and regulatory uncertainty.
