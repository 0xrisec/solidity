## Trades in traditional finance

To better understand how crypto liquidity pools work, it's important to first explore how traditional financial markets match buyers with sellers.

In traditional financial markets, buyers and sellers come together on a centralized platform such as a stock exchange where they can buy and sell securities like stocks, bonds, and other financial assets. The exchange acts as a middleman, matching buyers with sellers and ensuring that both parties receive what they agreed to.

To facilitate trading, the exchange relies on market makers which are entities that specialize in buying and selling specific securities to ensure that there is always liquidity in the market. Market makers make a profit by buying securities at the bid price and selling them at the ask price which is slightly higher. They help maintain liquidity in the market by standing ready to buy or sell securities at any time which ensures that there are always buyers and sellers available.

Let's say that you want to buy 100 shares of Company X which is listed on a stock exchange. You place an order with your broker to buy the shares at the current market price.

If there is a seller who is willing to sell you the shares at that price, your order will be executed, and you will become the owner of those shares. However, if there are no sellers available at that moment, your order will remain unfulfilled, and you will have to wait until a seller becomes available.

This is where market makers come in. Market makers are entities that specialize in buying and selling specific securities like Company X shares. They always stand ready to buy or sell the securities at the current market price, which ensures that there is always liquidity in the market.

So, in our example, if there are no sellers available at the moment you place your order, the market maker will step in and sell you the shares at the current market price. This ensures that your order is executed immediately, and you become the owner of the shares you wanted to buy.

Market makers are individuals or firms that facilitate trading in financial markets by buying and selling assets like stocks. They hold large amounts of these assets, which they make available to traders who want to buy or sell them.

Market makers quote two prices for these assets - the bid price and the ask price. The bid price is the price at which they are willing to buy the asset. While the ask price is the price at which they are willing to sell the asset. The difference between the bid price and the ask price is called the bid-ask spread.



CEX is a type of exchange where buyers and sellers interact with a centralized order book, and the exchange acts as a middleman to match the buyers and sellers. In a CEX, market makers play a crucial role in maintaining liquidity by placing orders on both the buy and sell side of the order book.

Market makers are entities or individuals that operate in financial markets by buying and selling securities or other financial assets to provide liquidity to the market. They do this by placing orders on both the buy and sell side of an order book, allowing buyers and sellers to transact with each other at any time.

Some of the top market maker companies in the world include:

1. Citadel Securities
2. Jane Street

An Automated Market Maker (AMM) is a type of decentralized exchange (DCX) mechanism used in cryptocurrency trading.

In a traditional order book-based exchange buyers and sellers place orders at specific prices and the exchange matches those orders determining a price based on supply and demand. In contrast, an AMM relies on a mathematical algorithm to automatically determine the price of an asset based on the ratio of assets in a liquidity pool.

In an AMM-based DCX, traders can add liquidity to a pool of funds by depositing both cryptocurrencies that will be traded against each other. For example, a user can deposit an equivalent amount of Ethereum and a different amount of another token into the pool, creating a new trading pair. This pool of liquidity is used to facilitate trades and the AMM algorithm determines the price based on the ratio of tokens in the pool.

When a trader wants to make a trade, they don't have to wait for someone else to take the opposite side of their trade as the AMM can execute it automatically. The trader simply needs to input the amount of one token they want to trade and the AMM calculates the number of tokens they will receive in exchange. This exchange rate is automatically adjusted based on the trading activity in the pool maintaining a balance between the two assets.

In summary, AMMs in DCXs offer a new way of trading cryptocurrencies, providing a decentralized and efficient mechanism for exchanging assets based on a mathematical algorithm.
