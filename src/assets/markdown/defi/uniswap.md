# Uniswap

Uniswap is a decentralized cryptocurrency exchange protocol built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to trade Ethereum-based tokens without the need for an intermediary or centralized exchange.

Uniswap uses an automated market maker (AMM) system to facilitate trades. This means that instead of relying on an order book like traditional exchanges, Uniswap relies on a liquidity pool where users can deposit their tokens and earn a share of the trading fees in return.

Trades on Uniswap are executed based on a mathematical formula that ensures that the price of each token in the pool is always balanced in proportion to the relative value of the tokens in the pool. This system makes it possible for users to trade tokens without the need for a centralized authority to match buyers and sellers.

If you're building a DeFi project or any decentralized application, Uniswap can be useful in two ways. 

1. Firstly, it provides a smart contract for buying and selling ERC20 tokens, making it easy for users to trade tokens in a decentralized manner. 
2. Secondly, Uniswap allows users to earn interest on their ERC20 tokens by becoming a liquidity provider.
